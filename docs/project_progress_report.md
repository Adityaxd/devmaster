- ProjectService: Full project lifecycle management
- WebSocketManager: Real-time updates for file and project changes
- File system operations working

## Current Work (Latest Commit)

### File System Implementation Complete
1. **Core Services Added**:
   - `FileSystemService`: Low-level file operations
   - `ProjectFileManager`: High-level project file management
   - `ProjectService`: Project lifecycle management
   - `WebSocketManager`: Real-time communication

2. **API Endpoints Created**:
   - `/api/v1/projects/` - Project CRUD operations
   - `/api/v1/projects/{id}/files` - File management
   - `/api/v1/projects/{id}/artifacts` - Code artifact storage
   - `/api/v1/projects/{id}/stats` - Project statistics

3. **Fixed Technical Debt**:
   - Updated all `datetime.utcnow()` to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
   - Added proper event types for file system operations
   - Implemented atomic file operations with rollback

4. **Test Coverage**:
   - Added comprehensive tests for FileSystemService
   - Tests cover all major operations including atomic transactions

## Next Steps (Immediate - Phase 2 Beginning)

1. **LLM Integration** (Critical):
   - Configure OpenAI/Anthropic API keys
   - Update IntentClassifier to use actual LLM
   - Implement proper prompt engineering
   - Add conversation memory

2. **Platform Primitives** (Week 5-8):
   - **Python-to-SQL Generator**: Parse SQLAlchemy models ‚Üí PostgreSQL DDL
   - **Business Logic-to-API Generator**: Parse service functions ‚Üí FastAPI routes
   - **FastAPI-to-TypeScript SDK Generator**: OpenAPI spec ‚Üí Type-safe client

3. **Specialist Agents**:
   - Implement PlanningAgent
   - Implement DataModelingAgent
   - Implement BackendLogicAgent
   - Implement FrontendAgent

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **File System Architecture**:
   - Virtual file system for in-memory representation
   - Atomic operations for consistency
   - Event-driven updates for real-time sync
   - Snapshot capability for backup/restore

2. **Project Management**:
   - Projects stored in `./projects` directory
   - Each project has isolated file system
   - Metadata stored in `.devmaster` directory
   - Support for multiple project types

3. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Per-project connection management
   - Real-time agent and file updates
   - Subscription-based notifications

## Technical Debt & Issues

1. **Authentication**:
   - Currently using dummy user IDs
   - Need to implement proper JWT authentication
   - Add user management endpoints

2. **Database Migrations**:
   - Need to create Alembic migrations for new models
   - Update existing migrations with latest schema

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve rollback mechanism for atomic operations
   - Add comprehensive error recovery

## Key Learnings

1. **File System Complexity**:
   - Atomic operations require careful transaction design
   - Virtual file system provides good abstraction
   - Event-driven updates essential for real-time sync

2. **Service Layer Benefits**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to test in isolation
   - Good foundation for agent integration

## Risk Mitigation

1. **LLM Integration Delay**:
   - Risk: Core functionality depends on LLM
   - Mitigation: Continue with mock implementations
   - Action: Prioritize LLM setup in next session

2. **Scaling Concerns**:
   - Risk: File system operations may bottleneck
   - Mitigation: Implement caching layer
   - Monitor: File operation performance metrics

## Repository Status

- **Local**: Clean working tree, all changes committed
- **GitHub**: Ready to sync
- **Branch**: main
- **Last Commit**: Implementing file system and project management services

## Latest Changes Summary

### Added:
- Complete file system service implementation
- Project management service with full lifecycle support
- WebSocket manager for real-time updates
- Comprehensive API endpoints for projects
- Tests for file system operations

### Fixed:
- All datetime.utcnow() deprecation warnings
- Missing event types for file operations
- Import issues resolved

### Next Commit Should Include:
1. LLM provider configuration
2. Updated IntentClassifier with actual LLM calls
3. Beginning of Platform Primitives implementation

## Blueprint Compliance Check

### ‚úÖ Following Blueprint:
1. **Convention over Configuration**: Standard project structure, sensible defaults
2. **Fixed Tech Stack**: Using prescribed technologies
3. **LangGraph Patterns**: Orchestration implemented correctly
4. **Multi-Layer Architecture**: Clean service layer separation
5. **Type Safety**: All models and services fully typed
6. **File System Service**: Week 4 requirement completed

### üîß Still Needed:
1. **Platform Primitives**: Core code generators (Week 5-8)
2. **LLM Integration**: Actual AI capabilities
3. **Specialist Agents**: Development workflow agents
4. **Frontend**: React + TypeScript setup
5. **Validation Pipeline**: L1, L2, L3 validation

## Phase 2 Readiness

We are now ready to begin Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8) - The Code Generation Engine:
- Week 5: Python-to-SQL Generator ‚è≥
- Week 6: Business Logic-to-API Generator ‚è≥
- Week 7: FastAPI-to-TypeScript SDK Generator ‚è≥
- Week 8: Code Generation Integration & Validation ‚è≥

The foundation is solid and we can now focus on building the high-leverage platform primitives that form the core value proposition of DevMaster.
