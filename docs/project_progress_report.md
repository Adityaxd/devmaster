## Completed Tasks

### Week 1: Project Setup & Architecture
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Created project directory at `/Users/adityachaudhary/Desktop/SummerProjects2K25/devmaster`
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Created project progress report

2. **Backend Setup (FastAPI)**
   - Initialized FastAPI application with proper structure
   - Configured Pydantic settings for environment management
   - Set up SQLAlchemy database configuration
   - Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
   - Added Dockerfile for containerization

3. **Frontend Setup (React + Vite)**
   - Initialized React project with TypeScript using Vite
   - Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Set up path aliases in vite.config.ts
   - Installed TanStack Query and Zustand for state management
   - Created Dockerfile for containerization

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Created Docker Compose configuration with services for PostgreSQL, Redis, Backend, and Frontend
   - Added health checks for all services
   - Configured volume mounts for hot reloading

### Week 2: Core Agent Infrastructure
1. **State Management System**
   - Created `DevMasterState` TypedDict following LangGraph patterns
   - Defined enums for TaskType, AgentStatus, and ProjectStatus
   - Implemented type-safe state structures for artifacts, messages, and validation results

2. **Base Agent Infrastructure**
   - Created `BaseAgent` abstract class with:
     - Standardized execution lifecycle
     - Error handling with retry logic
     - State update mechanisms
     - Agent handoff methods following LangGraph patterns
   - Implemented test agents (EchoAgent, SequentialTestAgent) for verification

3. **LangGraph Orchestration Engine**
   - Implemented `OrchestratorGraph` class using LangGraph StateGraph
   - Dynamic agent registration system
   - Conditional routing based on active_agent field
   - Proper state management and agent history tracking
   - No manual loops or if/else routing (following Tech Bible)

4. **Communication Protocols**
   - **WebSocket Manager**: Real-time updates to frontend
     - Connection management per project
     - Broadcast capabilities
     - Automatic disconnection handling
   - **Event System**: 
     - EventBus for UI updates (not inter-agent communication)
     - Typed events (EventType enum)
     - Automatic WebSocket broadcasting
   - **API Endpoints**:
     - `/api/v1/orchestration/test/echo` - Test single agent
     - `/api/v1/orchestration/test/sequence` - Test agent handoffs
     - `/api/v1/orchestration/ws/{project_id}` - WebSocket connection

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created pytest-based test suite
   - Tests for single agent execution
   - Tests for sequential agent handoffs
   - Verification of state updates and message flow

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **State Management**: Single shared state (DevMasterState) for all agents
2. **Agent Communication**: Only through state updates, no direct message passing
3. **Orchestration**: Pure LangGraph implementation, no custom routing logic
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket + Event system for UI communication
5. **Error Handling**: Tiered approach with retry, fallback, and human intervention

## Architecture Highlights
- **LangGraph Integration**: All orchestration uses StateGraph, no manual loops
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript/Pydantic typing throughout
- **Separation of Concerns**: Events for UI, State for agents
- **Testability**: Abstract base class allows easy mocking

## Next Steps (Week 3: Intent Classification System)
1. **Build Tier 1 IntentClassifier**
   - Implement LLM-based intent classification
   - Define ScopeIntent object structure
   - Handle multiple intent types

2. **Build Tier 2 CapabilityRouter**
   - Map intents to workflow templates
   - Implement workflow selection logic
   - Create routing decisions

3. **Integration**
   - Connect classifiers to orchestration engine
   - Add proper logging and monitoring
   - Create comprehensive tests

## Technical Stack Status
- ✅ **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- ✅ **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript & Vite
- ✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (shadcn/ui pending)
- ✅ **Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph patterns
- ✅ **State Management**: Zustand (frontend)
- ✅ **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (frontend)
- ✅ **Migrations**: Alembic (configured and working)

## Risk & Blockers
- None identified in Week 2

## Current Work in Progress (Week 2 - Session 3)

### Database Integration Complete
1. **Database Models Created** (in `backend/app/models/`)
   - Created all required SQLAlchemy models:
     - `User` model with authentication fields
     - `Project` model with full project tracking
     - `Execution` model for agent run tracking
     - `ExecutionMessage` for conversation history
     - `ExecutionArtifact` for generated files
   - Added proper relationships and indexes
   - Fixed SQLAlchemy reserved word conflicts

2. **Alembic Configuration**
   - Initialized Alembic for database migrations
   - Configured async/sync database engines properly
   - Created initial migration with all tables
   - Successfully applied migrations to PostgreSQL

3. **Infrastructure Updates**
   - Modified docker-compose to use port 5433 (avoiding conflict)
   - Created .env file with proper configuration
   - Set up dual database URLs (sync for migrations, async for app)
   - PostgreSQL container running and healthy

4. **Configuration Enhancements**
   - Updated `config.py` with separate sync/async database URLs
   - Added proper environment variable support
   - Configured database connection pooling

### Database Schema Highlights
- **Projects**: Track all user projects with status, type, and metadata
- **Executions**: Complete audit trail of agent runs
- **Messages**: Full conversation history with role tracking
- **Artifacts**: All generated code/files with validation status
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management

### Integration Status
- ✅ Database models follow DevMaster blueprint
- ✅ Alembic migrations working correctly
- ✅ PostgreSQL container operational
- ✅ All tables created with proper relationships
- ⏳ Need to integrate database operations with agent service
- ⏳ Need to update API endpoints for persistence

## GitHub Repository Status
- **Status**: Repository needs to be created on GitHub
- **Action Required**: Create repository at https://github.com/Adityaxd/devmaster and push commits

## Testing the Current Implementation
To test the orchestration system:

1. Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

2. Test endpoints:
```bash
# Test echo agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/orchestration/test/echo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello DevMaster!"}'

# Test sequential agents
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/orchestration/test/sequence \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Test sequential execution"}'
```

3. Connect WebSocket for real-time updates:
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/orchestration/ws/PROJECT_ID');
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log('Event:', JSON.parse(event.data));
```
